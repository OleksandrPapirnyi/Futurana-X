🌌 Game Overview
A retro-futuristic universe with post-ironic humor (think Futurama vibes) where players explore large biomes, complete quests, gather resources, and craft on-chain items.
Core loop is driven by daily energy that players spend across many activities: exploration, resource runs, crafting, mini-games, social hubs, and seasonal events.

🧩 Why It’s Unique
Theme you don’t see elsewhere: aliens + retro-futurism (very rare in Web2, non-existent in Web3).

Energy-based economy: daily energy caps drive retention and healthy item scarcity.

NFT heroes = real utility: unlock on-chain crafting, raise daily energy cap, early access to events, full ownership.

UE5 production value: modern rendering, large worlds, Niagara/Chaos FX.

🎮 NFT Heroes (Utility at a Glance)
Crafting gate: only NFT owners can craft on-chain items.

Higher daily energy cap: more actions and faster progress.

Early access: unique events and content first.

Customization: wearable items with in-game bonuses; distinctive looks (color palette, eyes, clean 3D backgrounds).

⚙️ What’s Already Built (Integrated & Playable)
Core systems implemented and working together in-engine.

🧪 Energy Economy (Short)
Daily energy limits actions → creates rhythm, scarcity, and reasons to return daily.

Energy can be extended via premium boosts and events.

NFT ownership raises the cap and unlocks on-chain crafting, feeding marketplace activity and fees.
